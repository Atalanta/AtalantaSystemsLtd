        <h1>Agile Infrastructure Consultancy</h1>

<p>If your core business depends on building and running software, you have two problems to solve, to stay competitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you continue to innovate and get your ideas to market quickly?</li>
<li>How can you ensure the services you provide or depend on remain reliable, perform well, and stay secure?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Atalanta Systems</b> eases the pain of managing the infrastructure on which your business depends, so you can focus on activities that deliver value, increase profitability, and enhance your presence in the market.</p>

<p>We specialise in providing solutions to these challenges, by building automated infrastructures, often taking advantage of the flexibility of the cloud, and by applying agile and lean principles to IT operations.</p>  

<p>We're experts at introducing a Devops approach to the software delivery lifecycle, and at building a mentality and culture inspired by the Lean Startup movement.</p> 


<h2>Why work with us?</h2>
<p>We have been leading the way in agile infrastructure development for nearly five years, and have a varied portfolio of large and small clients.</p>

<p>Our principal consultant and co-founder, Stephen Nelson-Smith, is internationally recognised as one of the foundational visionaries of the Devops movement, and a leading exponent of infrastructure-as-code, agile and lean methodologies, and cloud computing.</p>

<p> We have built strong relationships with leading service providers in the industry - people like Opscode and Amazon - and are well connected with prominent companies and individuals across the globe, people at the vanguard of the Devops movement.</p>

<p>Our consultants and engineers are all experienced Ruby and Python programmers in addition to Linux and Unix systems administrators, and are hand-picked for their creative and intelligent approach to problem solving.</p>

<p>We have decades of experience with open source software, and take a practical approach, often mixing in  commercial tools and developing bespoke applications and toolchains for our clients.</p>

<p>We have a history of happy clients and a business built primarily on referrals; a clear sign that we're getting it right for a lot of people.</p>

<p><b>Contact us today</b> to see how we can help your infrastructure bring value to your business.</p>
