        <h1>Agile Infrastructure Consultancy</h1>

<p> Atalanta Systems is a UK-based infrastructure consultancy, almost 5 years old, with a varied portfolio of small and large clients. </p>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We improve profitability for e-businesses and technology-driven start-ups for whom their technical infrastructure is mission-critical, by optimising their infrastructure and dev-to-ops processes. We help keep the infrastructure running smoothly, delivering
value in a way which allows the business to concentrate on the business rather than the plumbing.</p> 

<h2>How we do it</h2>
<p>By reducing waste in the value chain from software development to production.</p>
<p>By architecting and implementing highly available, resilient and secure infrastructures, delivered so as to minimise operational management cost.</p>
<P>By designing bespoke solutions using the best of the current tools and methodologies, including some of our own in-house tools.</p>
<p>With best-value resourcing and getting the best out of our people via Agile and Devops processes and philosophies.</p>
<p>By developing less-explored technology niches.</p>

<h2>Why we do it well</h2>
<p>We have been leading the way in agile infrastructure development for four years. Our principal consultant and co-founder, Stephen Nelson-Smith, is internationally recognised as one of the foundational visionaries of the Devops movement, and a leading exponent of infrastructure-as-code and cloud computing. We have close relationships with many of the leading services companies spearheading the adoption of cloud-based and infrastructure-as-code strategies.</p>
<p>We have a history of happy clients and a business built primarily on referrals; a clear sign that we're getting it right for a lot of people.</p>

<h2>In short</h2>
<p>We specialise in bringing the best out of e-businesses through agile and lean coaching, building highly available and scalable architectures, and implementing advanced automation, configuration management and monitoring tools.</p>
