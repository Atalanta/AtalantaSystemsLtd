      <h1>System Deployment & Automation</h1>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>As companies grow, IT infrastructures become complicated, arcane and heterogeneous.  Traditionally the relationship between number of servers and cost is directly proportional. Change management is a headache, knowledge is concentrated in the minds of a few and documentation is poor. Routine maintenance across such infrastructures is time-consuming, error-prone and frankly boring. The history of many systems is entirely unknown; rebuilding or replacing them in the event of damage or loss is enormously difficult. Server deployment is labour-intensive and time-consuming.  These are not just annoying technical problems - these hurt your bottom line. </p>

<p>These are problems facing every business that makes use of IT, problems that cost every business money and divert the attentions of technical staff away from areas which move business forward</p>

<p><h2>The Solution</h2></p> 

<p>Atalanta Systems has experience of these problems, across a range of companies from small start-ups through to large hosting providers and telecoms companies, and has selected and developed a suite of tools to automate systems in a way that improves their quality, saving money, improving reliability and providing auditability.  Using tools such as Puppet, Cobbler, Spacewalk and Func, Atalanta Systems will provide design, implementation, training, and support to centralise and automate your system's infrastructure, maximising your return on investment.</p>
<h2>The Benefits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Saves money - lower maintenance costs and higher system availability</li>
	<li>Allows focus on core business - improving efficiency and staff retention</li>
	<li>Reduces risk - systems are more reliable, knowledge is shared</li>
</ul>
